# Half-Stack Developer Website Source

This repository contains the source files for the website [half-stack.dev](https://half-stack.dev/).

Currently nothing more than a static blog generator:

- Use [marked](https://marked.js.org/) to compile markdown files
- Use [Lit](https://lit.dev/) to build web components
- Use [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) as transpiler and bundler
- Minimal templating with [template-html](https://github.com/grit96/template-html)
- And the good old gulp to build the whole thing

This will be my blog mainly for web development topics written in English.
